## Compile It

Hoping to switch to a different audio library soon, but as of right now you have to\
`apt install libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0`
or
`sudo pacman -S sdl2_mixer`

Clone the repository, compile, and run riff
```
git clone https://github.com/CarbonLollipop/riff.git
make
./riff <song/directory of songs>
```
### Windows
Good luck
